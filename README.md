# Matplotlib Reference
(See **Matplotlib_and_Seaborn_Reference.ipynb**.)

The syntax required to create data visualizations in Matplotlib and Seaborn is nuanced, dispersed across various web pages, and easily forgotten. For future reference, rather than searching through various online articles each time I need to use these libraries, I decided to create some data visualizations in Matplotlib and Seaborn which show how to create different graph types and to control the most common plotting elements, such as modifying axis titles and adding scatter plot points.

Note that these visualizations are not intended to be attractive or to respect data visualization best practices. Instead, the emphasis is on showing an easy-to-infer connection between different graphs and plotting elements and the Python code that generate them.
