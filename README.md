# Matplotlib Reference
(See **Matplotlib_Reference.ipynb**.)

The syntax required to create data visualizations in Matplotlib is nuanced, dispersed across various web pages, and easily forgotten. For future reference, rather than searching through various online articles each time I need to use Matplotlib, I decided to create two data visualizations in Matplotlib which show how to control the most common plotting elements, such as modifying axis titles and adding scatter plot points. **The first visualization demonstrates how to create a single plot**, and **the second visualization demonstrates how to create multiple plots which are then arranged in a grid**.

Note that neither of these visualizations are intended to be attractive or to respect data visualization best practices. Instead, the emphasis is on showing how to control the most common plotting elements as intuitively as possible.
